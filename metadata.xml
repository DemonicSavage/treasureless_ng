	<description>This mod makes it so when you skip the treasure room in a floor, you'll get a passive Afterbirth shop item in the next one.
		This is made as a sort of balance for the whole "some treasure rooms have no item" thing.
		This mod ignores whether the item you'll get has been unlocked or not, you'll get the item either way.
		This mod has a bug where it doesn't work if you reset the game in the first floor.
